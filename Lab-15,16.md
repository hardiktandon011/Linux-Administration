# Lab 15 & 16  

---  

## Experiment Description  
This lab focuses on writing shell scripts to:  
- Print system information.  
- Perform basic mathematical calculations.  
- Use redirection operators to store the output of commands.  

---  

## Approach  

### 1. Printing System Information  
A shell script is created to display system information like the hostname, kernel version, and system uptime.  

#### Script:  
bash
#!/bin/bash  
echo "System Information:"  
echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"  
echo "Kernel Version: $(uname -r)"  
echo "System Uptime: $(uptime -p)"  
  

#### Execution:  
bash
chmod +x system_info.sh  
./system_info.sh  
  

---  

### 2. Performing Basic Mathematical Calculations  
A shell script is created to perform basic arithmetic operations using the expr and bc commands.  

#### Script:  
bash
#!/bin/bash  
echo "Enter first number:"  
read num1  
echo "Enter second number:"  
read num2  

echo "Addition: $(expr $num1 + $num2)"  
echo "Subtraction: $(expr $num1 - $num2)"  
echo "Multiplication: $(expr $num1 \* $num2)"  
echo "Division: $(echo "scale=2; $num1 / $num2" | bc)"  
  

#### Execution:  
bash
chmod +x calculator.sh  
./calculator.sh  
  

---  

### 3. Using Redirection Operators  
Redirection operators (> and >>) are used to store command outputs into files.  

#### Example:  
bash
ls > file_list.txt  # Save the output of 'ls' command to file_list.txt  
df -h >> disk_usage.txt  # Append disk usage information to disk_usage.txt
